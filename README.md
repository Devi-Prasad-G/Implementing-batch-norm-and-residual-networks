# Implementing-batch-norm-and-residual-networks

-To solve the problem of vanishing gradients in deep networks we use batch normalization and residual connections within the network.
-In this project both batch normalization and residual connections are implemented from scratch and then analysis was made based on various hyperparameters.
-The report section contains the detailed explanation regarding the project.
